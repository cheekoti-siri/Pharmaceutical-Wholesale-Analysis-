#Overview
This project examines the profitability of pharmaceutical distributors by analyzing drug sales across different U.S. regions. By leveraging a combination of data engineering, data cleaning, BigQuery analytics, and visualization, we were able to identify top-performing distributors and high-demand drugs in each region.

#Use Case
Goal: Project demand for pharmaceutical products and evaluate distributor performance.
Industry: Healthcare (Pharmaceutical Wholesale)
Core Questions:
Which drugs are top-selling in each region?
Which distributors yield the highest profit margins?
How do wholesale costs impact overall revenue?

#Tools & Technologies
Data Cleaning: OpenRefine, Excel
Data Storage & Processing: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc
Visualization: Jupyter Notebooks (Matplotlib)
Languages: SQL, Python

#Data Sources
Static Data: Google Drive Dataset
Streaming Data: Data.gov

#Data Preparation
Cleaned and transformed 7,000+ rows using OpenRefine.
Corrected misspelled entries using clustering methods (e.g., Daitch-Mokotoff).
Calculated missing values (e.g., Gross Profit, Margin) using Excel formulas.

#BigQuery Analysis
Custom SQL queries with ROW_NUMBER() allowed selection of top-selling drugs by region and calculated:
Total order revenue
Gross profit margins
Distributor-specific performance

#Visualizations
Generated visual insights including:
Total Sales by Distributor
Profit by Distributor
Market Share (Pie Chart)
Top Drugs per Region

#Conclusion
Distributor B dominated in profitability across two regions with margins up to 99%, demonstrating strategic sales deployment. Distributor A and C also showed strong regional performance.
